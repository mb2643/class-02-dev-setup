  <p>Welcome to your first INFO1300 webpage!</p>

  <p>Welcome! We're so excited to share our love of animals with our neighbors, and we hope you come visit soon. Whether you stop by once while you're passing through town or come multiple times a week, you'll find the Ithaca Zoo is ready to welcome you with open arms.</p>

  Our next event is the Red Panda Meet and Greet, where you have a chance to meet our favorite little bundles of joy, Red and Fluffy. This will take place next Saturday from 1:00-4:30 PM. There will be a line so make sure to come early.</p>

<p>Jeff, like all giraffes, sleeps very little (&lt 30 minutes a night) in make sure he is alert &amp ready to avoid predators. No wonder he eats so much every day (&gt 50 pounds of leaves)!</p>
